        <h2>First Screening</h2>
        <p>The critic stepped into the dimly lit theater, the glow of neon reflections flickering off the polished floors. He approached the counter where a man stood behind the glass, motionless, expressionless.</p>
        <p>“What movie?” the ticket seller asked in a monotone voice.</p>
        <p>“Don (1978),” the critic replied.</p>
        <p>“That will be 10 credits.”</p>
        <p>The critic slid his payment across. The ticket seller handed over the special ticket and muttered, “Enjoy the experience.”</p>
        <p>The film played. A moment of silence. Then, a familiar voice filled the room: “Are Deewano Mujhe Pehchano”.</p>
        
        <h2>Second Screening</h2>
        <p>The next day, curiosity pulled him back. He returned to the counter.</p>
        <p>“What movie?” the ticket seller asked.</p>
        <p>“Don (1978),” the critic replied.</p>
        <p>“That will be 10 credits.”</p>
        <p>The seller handed him another special ticket and muttered, “Enjoy the experience.”</p>
        <p>The film played again. The song, “Are Deewano Mujhe Pehchano”, played—but was it slower? Was it… different?</p>
        
        <h2>Third Screening</h2>
        <p>A third visit. A third ticket. He returned to the counter.</p>
        <p>“What movie?” the ticket seller asked.</p>
        <p>“Don (1978),” the critic replied.</p>
        <p>“That will be 10 credits.”</p>
        <p>Another special ticket. “Enjoy the experience.”</p>
        <p>The critic loved it once more, but now, the differences felt sharper. The song… the lyrics had a slight variation.</p>
        
        <h2>Fourth Screening</h2>
        <p>Now, an experiment. The critic chose the exact same time slot as his first visit. He returned to the counter.</p>
        <p>“What movie?” the ticket seller asked.</p>
        <p>“Don (1978),” the critic replied.</p>
        <p>“That will be 10 credits.”</p>
        <p>The same words. The same tone. The same special ticket. “Enjoy the experience.”</p>
        <p>The theater door creaked open. The projector flickered to life. The film started.</p>
        <p>“Are Deewano Mujhe Pehchano…”</p>
